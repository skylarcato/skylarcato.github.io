                        Hello and welcome! I’m Skylar Cato, a dedicated IT professional specializing in Information Assurance and Cybersecurity, with a Bachelor’s degree from Capella University. Over the past four years, I have honed my skills in the telecommunications sector at T-Mobile, where I initially embarked on a journey as a Business Account Executive. During my three years in this role, I adeptly managed business sales, acquiring a deep understanding of cloud computing, B2B sales, and Software as a Service (SaaS).

                        In pursuit of further academic excellence and to deepen my expertise in cybersecurity, I transitioned to a role as a Sales Representative. This shift has allowed me to balance advancing my education while continuing to apply and expand my professional skills in a dynamic environment. I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and secure digital assets, aiming to blend cutting-edge tech knowledge with strategic business acumen.
